/**
In the blackjack casino game the player can take advantage of the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards left in the deck.

This is called card counting.

Having more high cards in the draw is an advantage for the player. A value is assigned to each card according to the following table.

1. When the count is positive, the player should bet high.
2. When the count is negative, the player should bet low.

Card Count Change
==================================
+1 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
0 7, 8, 9
-1 10, 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'

Our goal is to define a function for counting cards.

The function must take a letter parameter which can be a number or a string of characters and then increase or decrease the value of the global variable count according to the value of the letter (look at the letter).

The function should return a character string with the current count and the string:

1. "Bet" if the count is positive.
2. "Wait" if the count is zero or negative.

The current count and the player's decision ("Bet" or "Wait") must be separated by a space.

var counting = 0;

function countCards (card){
    var decision;
    switch (card){
        case 2:
        case 3:
        case 4:
        case 5:
        case 6:
        counting++;
        break;

        case 10:
        case "J":
        case "Q":
        case "K":
        case "A":
        counting --;
        break;

    }

    if (counting > 0){
        decision = "You should bet"
    } else {
        decision = "You should wait";
    }

    return counting + " " + decision;

}
console.log(countCards(2));
console.log(countCards(3));
console.log(countCards(7));
console.log(countCards("K"));
console.log(countCards("A"));
